This repository hosts my personal website, built with [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and deployed via GitHub Pages. Inspired by the great [Noam Lerner](https://noamlerner.com/).

## Running Locally

Clone the repo and start the Hugo server:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/barjacobi/barjacobi.github.io.git
cd barjacobi.github.io
hugo server -D
```

Visit [http://localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313) to preview the site.

## Deployment

Push changes to the `main` branch to update the live site.
