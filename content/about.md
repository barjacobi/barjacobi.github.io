## Hi, I’m Bar 👋🏻  

### About Me  
- I’m an MSc candidate in Bioinformatics at Tel Aviv University, where I work in [Prof. Adi Stern’s lab](https://www.sternadi.com/).  
- My research focuses on evolutionary biology and viral population genetics, with a particular interest in SARS-CoV-2.  

- Before grad school, I was a Production Engineer at Meta, specializing in system reliability and scalability.  
- I hold a BSc in Computer Science from the Technion.  

### Personal  
- I live in Ramat Gan, Israel, with my husband and our dog.  
- When I’m not working, I enjoy being a generalist—dabbling in gardening, sewing, cross-stitch, cooking, baking, and gaming.  

### This Website  
This site is a mix of blog, portfolio, and CV.  
It’s built with Hugo using the Congo theme and hosted on GitHub Pages.
