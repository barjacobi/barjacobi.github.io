In 2018, I was searching for my first student job. Other than stuffing branded bottles into bags and enjoying free food at job fairs, I didnâ€™t really know how to move forward. How do you even write a resume when you have no experience? Where do you start?

After quite a bit of trial and error, I finally landed my first job in the industry. Since then, Iâ€™ve gone through several positions, interviews, countless resume versions, and of course, received a lot of help from workshops, colleagues, and friends.



## About the Workshop

For a long time, I wanted to pay this forward, to share the knowledge and experience Iâ€™ve gained and make the process easier for others going through the same journey.  
Fortunately, I got the opportunity to run a workshop for students at the Technion.

There were a few delays, constraints, and even a war, but in the end, it finally happened yesterday!

It was exciting to return to the place where it all began, walk through the familiar hallways, and meet students with the same questions I had back then. It was a truly nostalgic and meaningful experience.

Iâ€™m sharing the workshop slides here, hoping that one day, those who find them useful might run their own workshops. Or at least, land a job ðŸ˜Š

*Note: The slides are in Hebrew, but I can provide a translation upon request.*
