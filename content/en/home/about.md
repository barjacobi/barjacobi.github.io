<div dir="ltr" style="text-align: left;">

I studied Computer Science at the [Technion](https://www.technion.ac.il/en/), where I earned my undergraduate degree.

After graduating, I worked as a [production engineer](https://engineering.fb.com/category/production-engineering/) at Meta (Facebook), focusing on large-scale systems, automation, and data-driven problem solving.

Today, I apply my technical background to bioinformatics, developing computational methods to explore viruses and other biological systems.

Outside of work, I enjoy creative pursuits like photography and embroidery, unwinding with a good book or a game, and spending time with my spouse and our dog.
